**Jiayu Chen** is an incoming **Tenure-Track Assistant Professor** at the [Department of Data and Systems Engineering, The University of Hong Kong](https://www.dase.hku.hk/). Currently, he is a **Postdoctoral Fellow** at the [School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), working under the supervision of [Professor Jeff Schneider](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~schneide/) on data-driven profile control for nuclear fusion, as part of a joint research program with the [Plasma Control Group, Princeton University](https://control.princeton.edu/).

Dr. Chen earned his **Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research** from the [Edwardson School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/IE) and a **Bachelor of Engineering** from the [College of Engineering, Peking University](https://www.coe.pku.edu.cn/). During his Ph.D., he was co-advised by [Professor Vaneet Aggarwal (Purdue University)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/CLANLabs), an expert in theoretical reinforcement learning, and [Professor Tian Lan (George Washington University)](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~tlan/), an expert in multi-agent systems. During his undergraduate studies, he worked under the supervision of [Professor Huijing Zhao (Peking University)](https://sai.pku.edu.cn/info/1177/1382.htm) and [Professor Ching-Yao Chan (University of California, Berkeley)](https://its.berkeley.edu/people/ching-yao-chan), focusing on intelligent robotics and self-driving technologies. 

He is the director of the [Agentic Intelligence Lab](https://agentic-intelligence-lab.org/), where his research focuses on **Learning for Sequential Decision-Making and Continuous Control.** Dr. Chen has published extensively in top venues such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICRA, ICAPS, AAMAS, TMLR, and IEEE TNNLS as the first author. His work has been recognized with prestigious awards, including the Oracle Research Award and the Purdue Research Grant.

Dr. Chen has served as reviewers or program committee members for leading machine learning and robotics conferences and journals, including NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, ICRA, AISTATS, L4DC, TMLR, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TITS, and SIAM SDM.
