**Zhen Yang (杨真)** [Personal Page](https://zcgyang.github.io/)

I am an incoming Ph.D. student in the [Department of Data and Systems Engineering](https://www.dase.hku.hk/) at the University of Hong Kong, advised by Assistant Professor [Jiayu Chen](https://www.dase.hku.hk/people/j-y-chen). Currently, I work as a research assistant at Westlake University, focusing on embodied intelligence. I got my bachelor's degree in Automation from China Agricultural University and master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Beihang University. 

**Research**: *"From bottom to top, from underwater to land"*

I'm a robot player driven by interests. I hope robots can work for me in the future (but I'd like to keep my job, thank you very much!) My research and work encompass various aspects of robotics, from foundational mechanical and electrical design to high-level manipulation, and from underwater bionic robots to land-based humanoid robots.  You can briefly understand my research field through my animation short film [Lateral Line](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1u54y1G7kc/).

**In addition to research**

I can perform [magic tricks](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV18z421d7Qt/), [sing](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1qFrFYMEzg), play basketball, swim, work out and other things unrelated to study. I'm also a Annual Update Zone UPloader [年更区UP主](https://space.bilibili.com/284672720). If you come to hang out with me when I'm stuck in my research, I would be very grateful.
