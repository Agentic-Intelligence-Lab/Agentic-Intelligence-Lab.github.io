Hi, I am Wenqi Ge (葛文琪), an incoming Ph.D. student in the [Department of Data and Systems Engineering](https://www.dase.hku.hk/) at the University of Hong Kong, advised by Assistant Professor [Jiayu Chen](https://www.dase.hku.hk/people/j-y-chen). Currently, I am a third-year Master’s student in the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering at the Southern University of Science and Technology. I received my B.Eng. (Outstanding Graduate) in Computer Science and Technology from Hefei University of Technology in 2022.

During my undergraduate studies, I served as the captain of the visual group for RoboMaster. Later, I interned at Tencent RoboticsX from March to September 2024, worked on dexterous manipulation and LLMs-driven object search during my Master's. My previous research mainly focused on robotic learning and scene understanding for robotics tasks, with several works published in RAL and IROS. Currently, my research is primarily centered on humanoid loco-manipulation tasks.
