# Research Areas

Our team at the Department of Data and Systems Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, specializes in **Learning for Sequential Decision-Making and Robotic Control.**


We are interested in advancing the following research areas:  

<!-- - Theoretical foundations, algorithm design, and applications of (Multi-agent) Reinforcement Learning;   -->
- Development of Robotic Foundation Models. 
- End-to-end multi-modal learning for Humanoid Robotic Control and its industrial applications.
- Post-training techniques for Large Language Model agents and their applications in complex reasoning or sequential decision-making tasks.
- Developing a unified theoretical framework for Reinforcement Learning, Optimal Control, and Stochastic Optimization.
- Investigation of scaling laws in sequential decision-making, with particular emphasis on scaling with data (e.g., data-driven decision-making) and computation (e.g., Monte Carlo Tree Search systems like AlphaZero).
<!-- - Artificial General Intelligence grounded in the principles of [The Alberta Plan](http://www.incompleteideas.net/Talks/AlbertaPlan.pdf). -->

Currently, we have three active research directions: Offline Reinforcement Learning for Controllable Nuclear Fusion, Continual Reinforcement Learning for Humanoid Robotic Control, and Learning-based Ego-centric Evolution within a Multi-agent System, of which more details are provided in the [introduction](http://agentic-intelligence-lab.org/files/research_topics.pdf).
