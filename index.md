# Research Areas

Our team at the Department of Data and Systems Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, specializes in **Learning for Sequential Decision-Making and Continuous Control.**


We are particularly interested in advancing the following research areas:  

- Theoretical foundations, algorithm design, and applications of (Multi-agent) Reinforcement Learning;  
- Developing a unified theoretical framework for Reinforcement Learning, Optimal Control, and Stochastic Optimization;  
- Scaling Laws in sequential decision-making, with a special emphasis on efficient (Multi-agent) Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithms and advanced Reasoning Models;  
- Robotic Foundation Models;  
- End-to-end multi-modal learning for Humanoid Robotic Control and its industrial applications;  
- Post-training techniques for Large Language Model agents and their applications in sequential decision-making;
- Artificial General Intelligence grounded in the principles of [The Alberta Plan](http://www.incompleteideas.net/Talks/AlbertaPlan.pdf).
