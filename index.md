# Research Areas

Our team at the Department of Data and Systems Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, specializes in **Learning for Sequential Decision-Making and Robotic Control.**


We are interested in advancing the following research areas:  

<!-- - Theoretical foundations, algorithm design, and applications of (Multi-agent) Reinforcement Learning;   -->
- Reinforcement Learning Theory and Algorithm Design.
- Development of Robotic Foundation Models, including VLA for Humanoid Robots and Generalist Household Robots. 
- Post-training for Large Language Model Agents.
- Data-driven Control for Nuclear Fusion.
- Unified Theoretical Framework for Reinforcement Learning, Optimal Control, and Stochastic Optimization.

Currently, we have three active research directions: Offline Reinforcement Learning for Controllable Nuclear Fusion, VLAs for Humanoid Robots, and Continual Reinforcement Learning. We aim at the Next-Generation Physical AI. Here is an interesting reading [list](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BP8e_H8NX8Xuf-hc4Dbcw1t2H5op7Mx3?usp=sharing).

<!-- and Learning-based Ego-centric Evolution within a Multi-agent System, of which more details are provided in the [introduction](http://agentic-intelligence-lab.org/files/research_topics.pdf).   -->

# How to join us

**Current Openings**  
(If interested, please contact [Dr. Jiayu Chen](https://agentic-intelligence-lab.org/members/jiayu-chen.html) directly. The Ph.D. application system accepts submissions year-round.)  

<!-- - **Two fully funded Ph.D. positions** starting in **Fall 2025 (as early as July)** -->
<!-- - Openings for **postdoctoral researchers**, **self-financed Ph.D. students**, **part-time Ph.D. students**, **research assistants**, and **visiting scholars** are available **year-round**  -->
<!-- - **Fully funded Ph.D. positions** starting in **Fall 2026** have been taken.  -->
- Openings for **self-financed Ph.D. students** and  **research assistants** are available **year-round**.
- ❗❗❗ We have available positions for (funded) research assistants on World Models and Robotic Foundation Models.
- ❗❗❗ We need several **remote research interns** to work on skill adaptation, real-to-sim, generative-model-based RL, or auto-deployment of embodiment intelligence. Please reach out to Dr. Jiayu Chen if interested. Our Ph.D. or MPhil candidates are usually selected among research interns.

**Qualifications for Ph.D. and Postdoctoral Researchers:**  
Candidates should possess **strong proficiency in mathematics or programming, as well as demonstrate self-motivation and resilience**. Applicants with backgrounds in the following areas are highly preferred: Humanoid Robots, 
Large Language/Reasoning Models, Statistical Machine Learning.

For more information, please refer to the respective categories in [openings](https://agentic-intelligence-lab.org/openings/).
