<p>Jiayu Chen (陈佳玉) is an incoming Tenure-Track Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://www.dase.hku.hk/">Department of Data and Systems Engineering, The University of Hong Kong</a>. Currently, he is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/">School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University</a>, working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~schneide/">Professor Jeff Schneider</a> on data-driven profile control for nuclear fusion, as part of a joint research program with the <a href="https://control.princeton.edu/">Plasma Control Group, Princeton University</a>.</p>

<p>Dr. Chen earned his Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research from the <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/IE">Edwardson School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University</a> and a Bachelor of Engineering from the <a href="https://www.coe.pku.edu.cn/">College of Engineering, Peking University</a>. During his Ph.D., he was co-advised by <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/CLANLabs">Professor Vaneet Aggarwal (Purdue University)</a>, an expert in theoretical reinforcement learning, and <a href="https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~tlan/">Professor Tian Lan (George Washington University)</a>, an expert in multi-agent systems.</p>

<p>He is the director of the <a href="https://agentic-intelligence-lab.org/">Agentic Intelligence Lab</a>, where his research focuses on Learning for Sequential Decision-Making and Continuous Control. Dr. Chen has published extensively in top venues such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICRA, ICAPS, AAMAS, TMLR, and IEEE TNNLS as the first author. His work has been recognized with prestigious awards, including the Oracle Research Award and the Purdue Research Grant.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-universitydepartment">About the University/Department</h2>

<p>Founded in 1911, the University of Hong Kong (HKU) is the oldest tertiary education institution in Hong Kong, renowned globally for its excellence in teaching, research, and innovation. According to the QS World University Rankings, HKU is currently ranked <strong>2nd in Asia</strong> and <strong>17th worldwide.</strong> Studying at HKU offers unique advantages: its location in the vibrant, internationally connected city of Hong Kong provides unmatched access to global business networks, a multicultural environment, and close proximity to the thriving economies of the Greater Bay Area.</p>

<p>In the midst of the artificial intelligence and big data revolution, the <a href="https://www.dase.hku.hk/about-us/introduction">Department of Data and Systems Engineering (DASE)</a> upholds the philosophy of “computing-in-practice”. The vision is to bridge the cyber and physical worlds by integrating data science methodologies, such as artificial intelligence, with human tools like robots to create greater value for humanity. To achieve this goal, DASE focuses on three key areas: <strong>Data Engineering and Analytics</strong>, <strong>Human-Machine Cooperation</strong>, and <strong>Robotics and Automation</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="research-areas">Research Areas</h2>

<p>The Agentic Intelligence Lab conducts broad research across Machine Learning, Robotics, and Operations Research. At present, our work focuses on advancing the following key areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Theoretical foundations, algorithm design, and applications of (Multi-agent) Reinforcement Learning;</li>
  <li>Developing a unified theoretical framework for Reinforcement Learning, Optimal Control, and Stochastic Optimization;</li>
  <li>Scaling Laws in sequential decision-making, with a special emphasis on efficient (Multi-agent) Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithms and advanced Reasoning Models;</li>
  <li>Robotic Foundation Models;</li>
  <li>End-to-end multi-modal learning for Humanoid Robotic Control and its industrial applications;</li>
  <li>Post-training techniques for Large Language Model agents and their applications in sequential decision-making;</li>
  <li>Artificial General Intelligence grounded in the principles of <a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/Talks/AlbertaPlan.pdf">The Alberta Plan</a>.</li>
</ul>
